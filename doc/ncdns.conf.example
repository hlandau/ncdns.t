[ncdns]
### This is a TOML configuration file. Values must be in quotes where shown.

### The interface to bind to. Defaults to ":53", which causes ncdns to attempt to
### bind to all interfaces on port 53. Unless you are running ncdns as root you
### will probably find that this fails. On Linux, you can run the following
### command on the ncdns binary to authorize it to bind to ports under 1024.
###
###   sudo setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' ./ncdns
###
### On BSD, there are sysctls to disable the low port restrictions.
#bind="127.0.0.1:53"

### Path to the file containing the KSK public key.
#publickey="etc/Kbit.+008+12345.key"

### Path to the file containing the KSK private key.
#privatekey="etc/Kbit.+008+12345.private"

### Path to the file containing the ZSK public key.
#zonepublickey="etc/Kbit.+008+12345.key"

### Path to the file containing the ZSK private key.
#zoneprivatekey="etc/Kbit.+008+12345.private"

### The address, in "hostname:port" format, of the Namecoin JSON-RPC interface.
#namecoinrpcaddress="127.0.0.1:8336"

### The username with which to connect to the Namecoin JSON-RPC interface.
#namecoinrpcusername="user"

### The password with which to connect to the Namecoin JSON-RPC interface.
#namecoinrpcpassword="password"

### ncdns needs to be able to state the hostname and IP address at which the
### nameserver lies. If SelfName is specified, ncdns lists the name specified as
### an NS record at the zone apex:
###
###   bit. IN NS ns1.example.com.
###
### This requires that you be able to assign the ncdns instance a hostname.
###
### If SelfName is left blank (the default), ncdns will generate an internal
### psuedo-hostname under the zone, which will resolve to the value of SelfIP.
###
### The default value of SelfIP is the bogus IP of "127.127.127.127", which will
### work acceptably in some cases (e.g. with Unbound).
#selfname="ns1.example.com."
#selfip="192.0.2.1"

### ncdns caches values retrieved from Namecoin. This value limits the number of
### items ncdns may store in its cache. The default value is 100.
#cachemaxentries=10

### Set this to enable the HTTP server.
#httplistenaddr=":8202"

### The template directory is usually detected automatically. If it cannot be found
### automatically, you must set the full path to it here manually.
#tplpath="../tpl"
